    <h1>Coco-yam</h1>
    <p>
        To avoid confusion, Cocoyam is the same as taro root.

        In many Asian countries,it is called Taro while
        <br>
         in many African countries such as Nigeria, 
         <br>
         it is referred to as cocoyam.But, if you intend <br>
         to go shopping in a typical Nigerian market, 
         <br>
         it is necessary that you know the types of <br>
         cocoyam in Nigeria.
